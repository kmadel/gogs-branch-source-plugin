<div>
    SCM Source implementation which provides a connector to import branches
    from Gogs.

    It will retrieve all branches available at indexing time. Username and password
    credentials are needed to access Gogs API (Scan Credentials field), and both SSH and username/password
    can be used for git checkout (see advanced options by clicking in the Advanced button below).

    If only "Scan Credentials" are provided they will be used for the scan process and git checkout.
